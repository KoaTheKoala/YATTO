					<!-- <b>Update(5/12/2015):</b> There's been an update (check the <a href="http://dd.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/35oeia/yatto_updates/">reddit post</a> for more details) that now uses a different format for cookies and state. You'll need to re-enter in your weapons (sorry!) but you can save the artifact portion of the save state (everything before the first "|"). You'll want to copy that portion, reset all cookies, refresh (everything will be defaults), then replace the default artifact portion with yours, then load from save state, and re-enter your weapons. -->
					<!-- <b>Update(5/20/2015):</b> An artifact calculator has been added to the reference page, and in doing so a few things about how artifact info is stored were changed, so please let me know if any values seem off. (Note: if the artifact levels aren't showing up on the reference page try going to calculator and back to reference.) -->
					<!-- <b>Update(5/20/2015):</b> Shoutouts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/roflswithcopters">/u/roflswithcopters</a> for helping me find a bug with my gold multiplier formula. Future's Fortune should be calculated correctly now. -->
					<!-- <b>Update(6/2/2015):</b> A couple of notes:
					<ul>
						<li>Let me know if you use the state string and/or url with <a href="http://strawpoll.me/4518673">this strawpoll</a>.</li>
						<li>Just a reminder in case you weren't aware, you can reorder the artifact list by dragging the crosses to the left of the artifacts, and clicking on the checkmarks to the left of each step will automatically apply it for you :D</li>
						<li>Also, a few people have mentioned having some issues with cookies, so I made a change to not automatically store to cookies if you open up a url with state. Keep your state/url somewhere safe and let me know if there are any issues.</li>
						<li>If you have artifacts at really low levels (compared to your other artifacts), relics/second and stages/second can be really slow and cause the whole thing to freeze up. I'm still working on this, so just fyi for now.</li>
					</ul> -->
					<!-- <b>Update(6/9/2015):</b> Yatto 2.0.0 is here! (<a href="http://redd.it/3962ct">reddit post</a>)
					<ul>
						<li>Artifact sequencer and weapon sequencer has been added.</li>
						<li>The reference page has been split into a reference page, with information about artifact and hero constants, and a formulas page, which has had a lot of formulas added to it.</li>
						<li>The state string has been removed. If you really want it you can still get at it by typing "document.getElementById("state-input").value" into the console.</li>
						<li>An option to take into account the Crit Strikes and Berserker's Rage actives has been added (please let me know if this doesn't seem to be cookie-d).</li>
						<li>Future's Fortune should be fixed for Dmg. Equivalent.</li>
						<li>A bunch of other small things that I don't remember/forgot to keep track of.</li>
						<li>Again, if you have artifacts at really low levels (compared to your other artifacts), relics/second and stages/second can be really slow and cause the whole thing to freeze up. I'm still working on this, so just fyi for now.</li>
						<li>Things have been changed so that if you have both a relic limit and a step limit it will quit once either of them has been reached (originally it would keep going until both limits are reached). A step limit of 0 indicates a default of 200 steps.</li>
					</ul> -->
					<!-- <b>Update(7/1/2015):</b> Yatto 3.0.0 is here! (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/3bqai0/yatto_300_accounts_file_upload/">reddit post</a>)
					<ul>
						<li><b>Yatto has a backend!</b> AKA, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VGAV9iU.jpg">accounts for everyone!</a> I'm not sure if this will eventually replace cookies (eh....), but I'm sure a lot of you will find it useful, especially for sharing, since you can now also see anyone's stats by going to yatto.me/#/calculator?username=[username]. I might add a "keep me private" option if people want it, but for now you could just not share your username.... >></li>
						<li>Ok the bad news - <b>this breaks all the old state urls and cookies</b>, so you'll need to re-input your information / update your bookmarks. Sorry >.< (The urls you get from here on out will still work, supposedly)</li>
						<li>To help with that a bit, <b>you can now upload your stats with your .adat file</b>. Select the file with the choose file button, then when the file name shows up, click "load info"</li>
						<li>Alright, this is how accounts work - click the login thing in the top right, then enter a username and password, and click register. I don't have any sort of password changing shenanigans yet, so get it right the first time :[ (Just kidding - I really don't have any way to change your password, but feel free to send me a message and I can delete the user for you) Once you're logged in, you can save your stats by clicking the "Save to Account" button. <b>Your stats are not automatically saved</b> (just technical reasons for now - I don't want you guys accidentally killing my server :<), but I do try to save them to your account if you leave/refresh/exit the page.</li>
						<li>Also the weapon sequencer has been reworked a bit. There's a limit of 500 weapons of lookahead (so that things don't die), and you can now click on the check next to a weapon to apply it and all previous weapons to your current stats (much like the artifact leveling steps).</li>
						<li>Random note - the tap damage/with crits/with actives stats on the left assume that your main hero is at level 600</li>
						<li><b>Filling in your hero levels does make a big difference in the calculations, so don't forget to do that. They don't need to be exact - the point is to know what hero skills you have.</b></li>
					</ul> -->
					<!-- <b>Update(9/24/2015):</b> Yatto hasn't been updated yet for the new customizations, so after you upload a save file make sure that your customization values are correct (other general things to check are that you have your hero levels filled out and that there aren't any blank fields) -->
					<!-- <b>Update(10/2/2015):</b> Quick update - loading .adat files should now not break the customization values, there are a few more colors in the weapon sequencer (option to simulate premiums is coming, I swear), and the save to account button finally has an indicator if it saved (pretty simple one, the text on the button changes). There are still a few major things I'm still working on (you can see some of the ideas <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/3kyelz/yatto_wishlist/">here</a>), but it's october and worlds has started so it might be slow going... -->
					<!-- <b>Update(10/15/2015):</b> Added some new stuff - there's now a page where you can optimize your customization buying (this isn't added to the state yet so won't be saved) and your hero level buying. You can also simulate using premiums now - there might be a few bugs in how calculating premiums interacts with when you click the checkmark, just let me know if something is off. I'm definitely getting more apathetic about the aesthetics of things, but the functionality should be there and I figured people won't mind as much as long as it works >> -->
					<!-- <b>Update(3/17/2016):</b> Quick note - I had to change a few things in my server setup/am tinkering with stuff so there might be some downtime over the next few days. Let me know if there are any issues :D -->
					<!-- <b>Update(4/7/2016):</b> Things should be more stable now, ish - again, let me know if there are any issues (/u/colblitz on Reddit) -->
					<!-- <b>Update(5/17/2016):</b> Yes, the new update (TT v. 4.0.0) has been coming out for some people, and yes I do plan on updating/adding to YATTO for the new content, but I myself don't have the update yet and I'll be out of town this weekend, so it may be some time before YATTO gets updated. Initial impression is that the new stuff is entirely isolated with no carry-over, so everything for the old stuff should still be valid.
					<h1>If you're on the new update (4.1.1) the optimizer AND THE SEQUENCER will be off (because they added a new artifact - Brew of Absorption is back!)</h1> -->
					<b>Update(5/18/2016):</b> New update (TT v. 4.1.1) seems to be out for everyone now, and again, yes I do plan on adding to YATTO for the new content, but I'll be out of town this weekend so no promises on when. <h3>The sequencer should be working again, to include Brew of Absorption, and the optimizer works, sort of - it doesn't yet take into account Brew's dps increase, so calculations are as if it only has All Damage.</h3>
					Let me know if the sequencer is wrong (/u/colblitz on Reddit) - it would be very useful to include screenshots of before/after, or even better have before/after versions of your savefile
