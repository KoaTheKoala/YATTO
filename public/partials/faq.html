			Hi! This is a page with information on it. It requires some reading.

			<h3 id="q00">What is YATTO?</h3>
			<p>YATTO stands for "Yet Another Tap Titans Optimizer." It's a tool built to help you with optimizing artifact leveling and various other Tap Titans-related calculations.</p>

			<h3 id="q01">Ok, how do I use this?</h3>
			<p>There's come to be a lot more on the main page than I originally anticipated, so things may be a bit confusing. There are three main areas on the calculator page - the top box for options and various stats, the left bottom box for inputting your stats, and the right bottom box for the calculated steps.</p>

			<p>Relics to spend and steps impose a limit on the calculations - it will stop after either one of these limits is reached. The actives inputs are for the level of your actives. The stats underneath the calculate button are based on your inputted stats (so everything besides all damage won't match unless your hero levels are exactly the same). The various methods give you options for spending your relics most effectively according to certain goals (description of each method below). The buttons on the right are for handling cookies (how browsers store information about your sessions on different websites), and the inputs below it are for calculating various things about your weapons. The url is a link for transferring your information around - going to the url will automatically input your state (but will not automatically save the state to your cookies, regardless of if you have the option on or not).</p>

			<p>The inputs should be pretty obvious. It's recommended to enter your hero levels at your wall</p>

			<p>After you click "calculate", a bunch of steps should show up in the right bottom box that tell you how to level your artifacts, with a summary of those steps at the top.</p>

			<p>For convenience you can drag and drop the artifacts (drag the cross-looking thingies), and you can click on the checkmark to the left of each step to automatically apply that step.</p>

			<h3 id="q02">It's not working for me, what do I do?</h3>
			<p>PM me on reddit (<reddit user="colblitz"/>) - it would help if you included your state url and/or screenshots of what's going. There might also be some information in the browser console (right click -> inspect element, and then in what pops up you should see a tab menu with "Elements", "Network", "Sources", "timeline," etc. - click on "Console", then try reloading). Otherwise, you can try the <a href="http://redd.it/303ngz">AEC</a> made by <reddit user="bsedmonds"/> (not sure when the last time it's been updated, though).</p>

			<h3 id="q10">Why do I need to input my hero levels?</h3>
			<p>So that YATTO knows what hero skills you have (they don't need to be exact levels, so you don't have to keep changing them every time). Unless you're in the very early-game, the vast majority of your tap damage is actually based on the %DPS skills that give you part of your hero damage, which is determined by your hero levels and hero skills, so knowing which skills you have makes a big difference.</p>

			<h3 id="q03">What do all the different methods mean?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Gold</b> - optimize for greatest gold gains, should match up with the gold column in the AEC (with maybe slight differences for Future's Fortune)</li>
				<li><b>All damage</b> - optimize for all damage (in just getting the highest percentage)</li>
				<li><b>Tap damage</b> - optimize for tap damage, which differs from all damage in that it also takes into consideration things like crits, hero levels, weapons, customizations, etc.</li>
				<li><b>Dmg Equivalent</b> - the newest method, uses the formula from <a href="http://redd.it/35e0wd">this thread</a> to convert gold increase to an equivalent damage increase in order to optimize for both at the same time</li>
				<li><b>Relics/second</b> - this works by simulating runs with various artifact levels in order to tell you what to level for the best relics/second - this is still pretty approximate, so no guarantees (also, the answer is usually to level UA)</li>
				<li><b>Stages/second</b> - similar to relics/s, this uses simulations, but the goal of this is to get the highest stage, with the least time taken being a secondary goal</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="q04">Why is it telling me to level a bunch of levels for Future's Fortune at once?</h3>
			<p>The multiplier that FF is involved in is rounded up, and so most upgrades don't actually have any effect except at certain levels when the multiplier ticks up. Given this, the current way of dealing with this step-ness is to treat the entire upgrade up to the next breakpoint as one step, and so effectively average the gold gain against the cost of upgrading multiple levels.</p>

			<h3 id="q05">How does the optimization actually work?</h3>
			<p>For each method there is a value that you calculate for certain sets of artifact levels (eg., for gold it's the overall gold multiplier). Given a starting list of artifact levels, calculate that value for this list, then calculate the value again for each artifact leveled up once. Find the artifact that gives you the greatest gain/relic cost, and level it. Repeat until you run out of relics or steps.</p>

			<h3 id="q06">Will this ever tell me to buy a new artifact?</h3>
			<p>Not yet, but hopefully someday (#THEDREAM). In theory, you can - with a given amount of relics, you can get an expected value across the artifacts you have left for gain/cost of whatever metric you're using. The problem is that buying an artifact is a large up front cost for a boost later on (since early leveling is cheap), and so just greedily taking the best option at each upgrade won't ever tell you to buy a new artifact. To get around this you can do a search across all possible upgrade paths (dynamic programming) to find if it becomes worth it in the long run (long run being the starting relics amount). The problem with this is that searching through all upgrade paths is stupidly slow, especially when you get a lot of cheap upgrades in the beginning (since you have roughly 33<sup>number of upgrades</sup> possible paths). I have a few ideas to get around this, but it's definitely still just a theory right now. </p>


<!-- 				Though now that I think about it, maybe I could just assume that if I buy a new artifact the first x upgrades will always be going to the new artifact since it'll most likely be the most cost effective... or maybe some other heuristic like "Assume new artifact is at a level that makes it the same cost effectiveness of your other artifacts - what's the overall gain/cost of buying the artifact then getting it to that level?" and then if that's better than leveling an existing artifact, buy it... -->


			<!-- <h3>What does greedy vs. dynamic programming mean?</h3>
			<p>A greedy algorithm is one where it will always pick the best option at each step, with no regard for long-term optimization. For example, if you're in a maze and your goal is to get to a certain point, then a greedy algorithm would try to always walk straight towards that point. Dynamic programming is one way of taking into account future options when making a current decision by breaking apart a problem into subproblems.</p> -->

			<!-- <h3>What is damage equivalent?</h3>
			<p>Damage equivalent is a way to compare both damage and gold artifacts by converting the gold gain into an equivalent damage gain. Refer to <a href="http://dd.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/35e0wd/relationship_between_gold_and_damage/">this thread</a> for more information.</p> -->

			<!-- <h3>Is your relics per second metric right?</h3>
			<p>Mostly - the metric is still experimental (I'm still tinkering with things), so no guarantees. However, it is likely that you'll be told to level Undead Aura a lot, which to me makes sense. There's no other artifact that would be able to get you a 5% increase in relics from just one level.</p>

			<h3>What is stages per second?</h3>
			<p>This is a metric that compares how far you can get (using my rough simulation), and then if the stages are equal decides based on time. This would be useful if you're gearing up for tournaments, where you only want to get as far as possible.</p>
 -->
			<!-- <h3 id="q07">What is the \(\chi^2\) - weapon probability?</h3>
			<p>The weapon probablity is supposed to give you a measure of how likely your distribution of weapons was just from chance. The higher the number, the more "normal" it is. This is calculated by running a chi-square test on your weapon counts, and is not really useful for anything - it's mostly just a point of academic interest (the probability to get next set is a lot more practical)</p> -->

			<!-- <h3 id="q08">My probability to get the next weapon set is 0, what's up with that?</h3>
			<p>Unless you're getting fewer weapons than you need, it's probably not actually zero - it's just that the chance is too small and doesn't fit in the box so I'm displaying it as zero. On that note, max probability is 1, so a probability of 0.0001 is a 0.01% chance.</p> -->

			<h3 id="q09">This is cool, can I take a look at how you did it?</h3>
			<p>Sure, git repo is <a href="https://github.com/colblitz/YATTO">here</a></p>
